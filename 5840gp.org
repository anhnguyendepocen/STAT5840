*** Make-up policy:
*Late homework or projects* will be penalized 10% of the grade per
day.

*** Homework and projects: 
Exercises will be assigned during class. Some of these will be
collected. It may become necessary to do some of these exercises
during class; if so, I will let you know ahead of time. Grades will be
based on performance on these exercises.

*** Attendance: 
It is expected that you will make every possible effort to attend all
classes. Although I feel that it is essential for you to attend class,
no direct punishment will be assessed to your final grade if you
choose not to attend class. Students who miss class are responsible
for finding out any pertinent information concerning the course from
the instructor.

*** Recommendations: 
- Successful students have found that the subject demands frequent
  intensive study with lots of problem solving.
- Participation in group discussions is often helpful to yourself and
  others in learning.
- If you have any special problems or learning difficulties, please
  contact me immediately.
