* Simulating Beta(2.5, 4.5) Random Variables: Which method is better?
We wish to simulate Beta(2.5,4.5) random variables with target density
\[
f(x) \propto x^{1.5}(1-x)^{3.5}.
\]
To do this we will use the Accept/Reject Algorithm with two different instrumental densities.

- Method I: :: Use uniform RV’s with instrumental density
   \[
   g_{1}(x) = 1,\quad 0 < x < 1.
   \]
   *Notes:*
   - you may use \(M \approx 0.0472\).
   - to simulate from \(g_{1}\) use the command =x <- runif(1)=.
- Method II: :: Use the average of two uniform RV’s with instrumental density
   \[
   g_{2}(x) = 2 - |4x - 2|,\quad 0 < x <1.
   \]
   *Notes:*
   - you may use \(M \approx 0.0554\).
   - the =R= function for absolute value is =abs=.
   - to simulate from \(g_{2}\) use the command =x <- mean(runif(2))=.


* Question: Which method is better?
1. Write a program that simulates 10,000 Beta(2.5,4.5) random variables using both methods.  
2. Compare the acceptance rates and decide which one is the better algorithm.
3. Graph histograms of your results.
4. Write a report that includes your program, your histograms, and a paragraph that summarizes your findings.

*Hints:*
- Download =rand_norm.R= and modify it to suit your needs by changing the target and instrumental densities.  You could call the new one =rand_beta.R=.
- It may help to write two separate programs, =rand_beta1.R= and =rand_beta2.R=.
