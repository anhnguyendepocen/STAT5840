In order to process these notes you will need to have at least the following packages installed in R (together with their dependencies).  I generated this list by going through notes.org and looking for library() calls.  If these packages are not installed then you will not be able to generate the notes by yourself.

ggplot2
lattice
distr
LearnBayes
